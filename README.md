This is a React learning project from the Udemy React course with Max Schwarzmueller.

While a link to the full solution is given at the end of the course, I followed every module and did the entire code-along.

This project gives a brief overview of animations in React using 'react-transition-group'

This app is deployed to GitHub pages at:
